# Motivation 
I have been a foster parent before and have adopted my own children from foster care. By going through this process, I was shown the amount of children and especially teens in the foster care system and seen the affects it can have on their education and the difficulties they face. I started out wanting to figure out how many teens age out of foster care, but I was not able to find public information for that question. My research into the topic did however lead me to public data for foster care children and school performance. From this I began wanting to investigate the affects being in foster care and those unique challenges that arise have on school performance and ultimately graduation from high school. 

# Data Source
The data was collected by [ERDC](https://erdc.wa.gov/) (Education Research and Data Center) for Washington State [DCYF](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/practice/oiaa/reports) (Department of Children Youth & Families) and made public in a 2019 report. The data is from Washington state schools, years 2012-2017. The four year graduation data was from year 2015.
